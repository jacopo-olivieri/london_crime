# London Crime Dashboard - Development Session Summary

## Project Overview
Complete R data pipeline and interactive Shiny dashboard for London crime data analysis using Police.uk API data from 2023-01 to 2025-05 (29 months, ~2.5M records).

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup âœ…
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jacopo-olivieri/london_crime
- Successfully uploaded with comprehensive project structure
- Proper .gitignore excluding large files but including deployment essentials
- All code, documentation, and necessary data files committed

### 2. Posit Connect Cloud Deployment âœ… (Initial)
- Successfully deployed basic Shiny dashboard to Connect Cloud
- Resolved multiple technical challenges:
  - **Platform specification**: Added correct platform info to manifest.json
  - **Package installation**: Used rsconnect-generated manifest for proper dependencies
  - **renv conflicts**: Excluded renv from cloud deployment

### 3. Dashboard Enhancement with Real Data âœ…
**Transformed from demo to production system:**
- **Real crime data**: 29 months (2023-01 to 2025-05) from Police.uk API
- **Proper mapping**: Authentic London borough shapefiles (removed LSOA complexity)
- **Borough-only focus**: Simplified for performance and clarity
- **Enhanced features**: Crime rate calculations, better filtering, trend analysis

### 4. Current Deployment Issue ðŸš¨
**Problem**: Persistent "shiny package was not found" error on Connect Cloud
**Status**: Fixed with explicit minimal manifest.json (awaiting deployment test)

### Data Pipeline Architecture
1. **Borough-by-borough API collection** (33 London boroughs)
2. **Spatial processing** with LSOA assignment using sf
3. **Parquet caching** with Arrow for high-performance storage
4. **Interactive dashboard** with Leaflet maps, Plotly charts, DT tables

### Dashboard Features (app.R)
- **4 main tabs**: Crime Map, Statistics, Trends, Data Explorer
- **Interactive mapping**: Borough-level choropleth with Leaflet
- **Real-time filtering**: Date range, boroughs, crime types
- **Crime rate calculations**: Per 1,000 population estimates
- **Trend analysis**: Monthly/quarterly/yearly comparisons
- **Data export**: CSV download functionality

## Current Connect Cloud Deployment Status

### Last Deployment Attempt
**Issue**: "The shiny package was not found in the library" error
**Root Cause**: Complex auto-generated manifest.json not properly specifying shiny dependency

### Solution Applied (Latest Commit: 8765e77)
- **Explicit minimal manifest.json** with 15 essential packages
- **Shiny listed first** with clear version specification (1.9.1)
- **Verified app.R** has proper library loading order (shiny first)
- **Streamlined dependencies** to avoid conflicts

### Deployment Process
1. Go to Posit Connect Cloud
2. Select "Publish" â†’ "Shiny" â†’ GitHub repository
3. Choose `app.R` as primary file
4. Monitor deployment logs for successful shiny package loading

## Git Repository Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest commit**: 8765e77 (shiny dependency fix)
- **Files ready for deployment**: 
  - 32 data files (29 parquet + boundaries + .gitkeep files)
  - Enhanced app.R with real data
  - Fixed manifest.json with explicit dependencies

## Key Files to Know

### app.R (Production Dashboard)
- **Real data loading**: Parquet files from data/processed/
- **Borough boundaries**: data/borough_boundaries_deployment.rds
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- **Performance optimized**: Borough-level only, efficient data loading

### manifest.json (Connect Cloud Dependencies)
- **Explicit shiny dependency**: Version 1.9.1, CRAN source
- **15 essential packages**: shiny, shinydashboard, leaflet, plotly, DT, sf, dplyr, etc.
- **Platform**: 4.5.0 (Connect Cloud compatible)

### Data Files Included in Git
- **Crime data**: 29 parquet files (2023-01 to 2025-05)
- **Borough boundaries**: 2.2MB RDS file with proper London shapefiles
- **Total size**: ~400MB of crime data + boundaries

## Next Steps for New Claude Instance

1. **Test Connect Cloud deployment** with fixed manifest.json
2. **Monitor deployment logs** for successful shiny package installation
3. **Verify dashboard functionality** with real crime data
4. **Address any remaining deployment issues** if they arise

## Important Notes

### What Works Locally âœ…
- All R scripts and functions work perfectly
- App.R loads successfully with 29 months of real data
- Borough boundaries render correctly
- Full data pipeline operational

### Connect Cloud Challenge ðŸš¨
- Persistent shiny package installation issue
- Latest fix: explicit minimal manifest.json (should resolve)
- All other packages install correctly

### Data Quality âœ…
- **Real Police.uk data**: 2023-01 to 2025-05 (29 months)
- **Spatial accuracy**: Proper London borough boundaries
- **Data integrity**: All crime records properly geocoded
- **Performance optimized**: Parquet format for fast loading

## Contact & Repository
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/jacopo-olivieri/london_crime
- **Current status**: Ready for Connect Cloud deployment retry
- **Expected outcome**: Production London crime dashboard with real UK data
